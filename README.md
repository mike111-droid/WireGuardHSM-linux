# WireguardHSM-linux
## Daemon to run Wireguard as WireguardHSM on Linux

### Introduction
This program is the attempt to include a Hardware Security Module into the Wireguard VPN. For this I used the SmartCard-HSM USB Token (https://www.cardomatic.de/SmartCard-HSM-4K-USB-Token). In order for two communications peers to use this feature you need to identical keys on two seperat SmartCard-HSM's. The following will describe how to setup this application on Linux Ubuntu (it migth work on other distros too but was not tested there).
